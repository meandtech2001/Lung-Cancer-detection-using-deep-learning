<h1> Introduction </h1>
<p> 
In this study, an automatic segmentation method using deep learning is proposed which segments the liver and its tumours using the modified ResUNet model. In addition to the precise automated tumour segmentation, the projected system shows an ability to accurately segment the liver, evidenced by the highest achieved Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) metric, compared to the related work for tumour and liver segmentation. Deep learning approaches make full use of the database, i.e., to train a set of convolutional features that can describe the segmentation problem, the CT images and the corresponding Ground Truth (GT) segmentations by the radiologists. Generally, to learn the problem deep approaches use a huge number of parameters (i.e., millions). In the last decade, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architectures have reached outstanding performance in liver and lesion segmentations. In general, deep learning algorithms use a large number of parameters (millions) to learn the problem. The algorithms used in deep learning make full use of the database, i.e., to train a collection of convolutional features that can characterize the segmentation problem, the CT images, and the radiologists' associated Ground Truth (GT) segmentations. However, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures have achieved exceptional performance in liver and lesion segmentation throughout the last decade. In this paper, an automatic segmentation method using deep learning is proposed which segments the liver and its tumours using the modified ResUNet model. In addition to the precise automated tumour segmentation, the projected system shows an ability to accurately segment the liver, evidenced by the highest achieved Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) metric, compared to the related work for tumour and liver segmentation. The improved ResUNet model is used to segment the liver and associated tumours using an automatic segmentation method based on deep learning. In addition to exact automated tumour segmentation, the proposed system can accurately segment the liver, as indicated by the highest achievable Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) metric when compared to related work for tumour and liver segmentation. The study proposes an autonomous deep-learning segmentation method for the liver and associated tumours using the updated ResUNet model. In addition to accurate automated tumour segmentation, the proposed system can accurately segment the liver, as indicated by the highest achievable Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) metric when compared to related work for tumour and liver segmentation.
